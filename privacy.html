            <h2 >1. Data Collection</h2>
            <p>Our Inclinometer app accesses your device's <strong>accelerometer and gyroscope sensors</strong> to calculate surface angles. This data is processed locally on your device in real-time. We do not collect, store, or transmit this sensor data to any external servers.</p>

            <h2>2. Device Permissions</h2>
            <p>To function, the app requires "Device Orientation" permissions. This is used solely for the mathematical calculation of the pitch and roll of your device.</p>

            <h2 >3. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>We do not sell or share any user information. If this app is hosted on a third-party platform (like GitHub Pages or Vercel), they may collect basic web logs (IP addresses) for security purposes.</p>
