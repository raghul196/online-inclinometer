                <h2 class="subsection-title">Introduction</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-margin">
                    Welcome to Online Inclinometer! We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our web application handles your information, especially regarding data collected from your device's sensors.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-6">
                <h2 class="subsection-title">1. Data Collection & Use (No Personal Data)</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-margin">
                    Our Online Inclinometer app is designed with your privacy as a priority. It functions by accessing your device's built-in <strong>accelerometer and gyroscope sensors</strong> to calculate surface angles (pitch and roll).
                </p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All sensor data is processed exclusively on your device, in real-time, within your web browser. This means the data required for the inclinometer's functionality never leaves your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Storage:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your sensor data, measurements, or personal information to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not track your usage patterns, IP addresses, location data, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-6">
                <h2 class="subsection-title">2. Device Permissions</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-margin">
                    To operate, the app requires "Device Motion" or "Device Orientation" permissions from your browser.
                </p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This permission is solely used to access the raw sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) needed for the mathematical calculation of your device's pitch and roll angles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You are in control of granting or denying these permissions. If denied, the inclinometer functionality will not work. Granting permission does not allow us to collect or transmit any data from your device.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
